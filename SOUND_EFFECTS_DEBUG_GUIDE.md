# 🔊 Sound Effects Debug Guide

## What I Just Fixed:

### 1. Made Sound Effects LOUDER
- Increased volume from 30% to 50%
- Made them 50-300ms long (was 100ms)
- Higher frequencies (easier to hear)

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Every sound effect now logs to console:
```
🎵 Sound effect requested: click
⚠️ Audio file not found for click, using beep fallback
🔊 Playing click sound effect (1200Hz, 0.08s)
```

### 3. Added Audio Test Panel
A floating test panel appears in bottom-right corner of your app!

2. Refresh browser (Ctrl+R)
3. Check browser console for errors

### ❌ Don't Hear Beeps?
1. **Check the speaker icon** in the test panel
   - Should be 🔊 (unmuted)
   - If 🔇 (muted), click to unmute
2. **Check your computer volume**
   - Windows volume should be > 50%
