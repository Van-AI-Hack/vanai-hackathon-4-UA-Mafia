## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Audio Service Architecture:**
```typescript
class DashboardAudioManager {
  // Smart track selection based on user context
  getTrackForDiscoveryMethod(discoveryMethod: string): AudioTrack | null
  
  // Smooth audio transitions
  async playDiscoveryMethod(discoveryMethod: string): Promise<void>
  fadeOut(duration: number): Promise<void>
  fadeIn(duration: number): void
  
  // Context management
  setUserContext(context: UserContext): void
}
```

### **Hover Detection:**
```typescript
// Enhanced discovery method detection
const getDiscoveryMethodFromHover = (point: any): string | null => {
  // Maps Plotly hover events to discovery methods
  // Supports all 6 discovery methods with intelligent matching
}
```

### **Visual Integration:**
```typescript
// Real-time audio indicator
{isAudioPlaying && currentPlayingMethod && (
  <span className="text-xs px-2 py-1 bg-green-400/20 text-green-400 rounded-full flex items-center gap-1">
    <span className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-400 rounded-full animate-pulse"></span>
    {currentPlayingMethod} Playing
  </span>
)}
```
