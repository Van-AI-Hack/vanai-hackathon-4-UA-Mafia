## âœ… **Verification**

After uploading, test that files are accessible:

1. Visit your Cloudinary URL:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/raw/upload/canadian-music-dna/avatars/digital-explorer-tech-savvy-youth-3d-model.glb
   ```

2. The file should download or open

3. Repeat for all 5 files

## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues**

### **Issue: File size too large**
- **Solution**: Cloudinary free tier supports up to 100MB files
- Your files are ~20-23MB each, so they should work fine

### **Issue: Wrong public ID**
- **Solution**: Make sure to use exact names from the table above
- **Solution**: No spaces, use hyphens instead
- **Solution**: Don't include file extension in Public ID

### **Issue: Wrong resource type**
- **Solution**: Make sure "Resource Type" is set to "Raw" not "Image"

---

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Result**

Once all files are uploaded:
- âœ… 5 files in `canadian-music-dna/avatars/` folder
- âœ… Each file ~20-23MB
- âœ… All files accessible via direct URL
- âœ… Your app will load avatars from Cloudinary
