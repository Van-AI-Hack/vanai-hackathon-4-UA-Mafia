## 🎛️ The Code That Creates Music

### Location:
**File:** `web/src/utils/audioManager.ts`
**Function:** `generateAmbientTone()` (lines 83-178)

### What It Does:

```typescript
// 1. Creates an Audio Context (browser's audio engine)
this.audioContext = new AudioContext()

// 2. Creates MULTIPLE OSCILLATORS (electronic sound generators)
const osc = this.audioContext.createOscillator()
osc.type = 'sine'  // or 'triangle', 'sawtooth', 'square'
osc.frequency.value = 220  // Hz (A3 note)

// 3. Adds MODULATION (makes sound move/evolve)
const lfo = this.audioContext.createOscillator()
lfo.frequency.value = 0.5  // Wobbles 0.5 times per second
lfo.connect(osc.frequency)  // Modulates the main oscillator

// 4. Adds FILTERS (shapes the sound)
const filter = this.audioContext.createBiquadFilter()
filter.type = 'lowpass'
filter.frequency.value = 800  // Removes harsh frequencies

// 5. STARTS PLAYING
osc.start()  // Music begins!
```

## 🎨 Each Persona Has Unique Sound

### Persona 0: Nostalgic Waves
```typescript
baseFreqs: [220, 165, 130]  // Lower, warmer tones
waveTypes: ['sine', 'triangle', 'sine']  // Smooth
lfoRate: 0.3  // Slow, gentle movement
```
**Result:** Warm, vintage radio vibes

### Persona 1: Digital Discovery
```typescript
baseFreqs: [440, 330, 275]  // Higher, brighter tones
waveTypes: ['triangle', 'sawtooth', 'sine']  // Digital texture
lfoRate: 0.5  // Faster movement
```
**Result:** Modern streaming energy

### Persona 2: Traditional Harmony
```typescript
baseFreqs: [196, 147, 110]  // Mid-low, mellow tones
waveTypes: ['sine', 'sine', 'triangle']  // Pure, classic
lfoRate: 0.2  // Very slow, stable
```
**Result:** Traditional Canadian sound

### Persona 3: Future Beats
```typescript
baseFreqs: [523, 392, 294]  // High, bright tones
waveTypes: ['sawtooth', 'square', 'triangle']  // Edgy, electronic
lfoRate: 0.7  // Fast, energetic
```
**Result:** Futuristic sci-fi

### Persona 4: Social Vibes
```typescript
baseFreqs: [349, 261, 196]  // Bright, happy tones
waveTypes: ['triangle', 'sine', 'sawtooth']  // Mixed character
lfoRate: 0.6  // Upbeat movement
```
**Result:** Party-ready energy

## 🔊 How To Check If It's Working

### Option 1: Browser Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Complete the quiz
4. Look for: **`🎵 Playing [Name] soundscape`**

### Option 2: Audio Controls
1. Complete the quiz
2. Look for the audio player (music note icon)
3. See: "**AI-Generated Soundscape**"
4. Click pause ⏸️ - Music stops
5. Click play ▶️ - Music resumes

### Option 3: Volume Slider
1. Hover over the audio player
2. Volume slider appears on the right
3. Drag left/right - volume changes **in real-time**
4. This proves it's live audio synthesis!

## 🎤 What To Say During Demo

**Instead of:**
❌ "We play background music"

**Say This:**
✅ "We use the Web Audio API to generate real-time ambient soundscapes. 
Each persona has a unique configuration of oscillators, LFO modulation, 
and filters. The audio is synthesized procedurally with no MP3 files - 
just pure JavaScript and browser audio technology."

**Judges will be impressed because:**
- It's technically sophisticated
- Most teams won't have this
- It demonstrates deep technical knowledge
- It's actually harder than using pre-made files!
